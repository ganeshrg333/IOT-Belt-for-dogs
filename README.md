# IOT-Belt-for-dogs
This is my internship project. As the life of humans is important, similarly the life of pets are also important.  They cannot tell about the problems that they face, but by observing their body movement and physical behavior we can identify their problems. As nowadays, people don't get time from work to take care of their pet, so this device helps to get the information about the pet’s health. Internet of Things (IoT) provides efficient technical support for the biology and zoology research. We can use this technology for getting information about pets. The sensors such as temperature sensor, GPS, pulse sensor, motion sensor helps to monitor the dog. These sensors are interfaced with the NodeMCU ESP8266. NodeMCU is the Wi-Fi module which collects the information from the sensors and displays it on the website. These all temperature sensors are located on the belt of the dog. Sensors provide the body temperature, pulse rate (in bpm), location and activity or motion of the dog. The information is displayed on Ubidots. Ubidots is an Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics and visualization company which converts the sensor data into information. This helps the user to know about the health of dog from any corner of the world by just logging in into ubidots.
